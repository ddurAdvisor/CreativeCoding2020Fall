Who else will be on stage?
While the duel between the old guard heavyweights unfolds, younger candidates will have a chance to present themselves as the future of the Democratic party.
Two other top-tier candidates will set out their policy stalls: Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and 54-year-old Senator Kamala Harris of California.
Both enjoyed brief initial surges in popularity, but their campaigns have so far not lived up to supporters' high hopes.
Mr Buttigieg, a Harvard-educated military veteran, has been criticised back home for his handling of the police shooting of a black man, exposing fissures in his appeal to African Americans.
